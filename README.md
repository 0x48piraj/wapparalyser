    <i>Fuzzing 'n' Fooling Wappalyzer</i>
</p>

Wapparalyser is a security tool for blue-teams which defeats [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/), a common red-team tool that uncovers the technologies used on websites.

Wapparalyser was presented at BSides Delhi 2019. The command-line tool is built on Python and it has been completely written from the ground-up, after reverse-enginnering Wappalyzer to it's core and thus, it is highly flexible and automatically adapts without manually inserting any new heuristics/fingerprints. It intercepts all the static detections that Wappalyzer uses in order to camouflage, modify and defeat the tool in real-time.

Wapparalyser will have an interactive web-app in near future.
